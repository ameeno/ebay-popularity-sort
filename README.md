# Usage

1. Install the extension from FireFox web store
2. Search eBay for something ([Edison bulb](http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?LH_BIN=1&_from=R40&_sacat=0&_sop=12&_nkw=edison+bulb&_ipg=200&rt=nc)) and make sure `Buy It Now` and `Best Match` are selected
3. Scroll down to bottom of page and set `Items per page` to `200` for this to work better

Enjoy search results sorted by popularity!

I have forked and made changes to allow compatibility with FireFox.
